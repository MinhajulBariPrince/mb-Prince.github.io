Education
======

* B.Sc. in Civil Engineering (January,2023)<br>
    Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology<br>
    Concentration: Structural Engineering<br>
    CGPA: 3.707 on a scale of 4.00 [-Details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Dq5vBtmrEPv0bwcRh4kC7Cz_ea_bDvl/view?usp=sharing)<br>
    Class Rank: 7th out of 140 civil engineering students

Research interest
======
* Investigation on global behavior of buildings as well as local behavior of structural elements under seismic loads
* Seismic strengthening of structural bodies using smart materials
* Prediction of fracture in structural bodies under impact and seismic loads
* Understanding wave propagation in structural bodies


Research experience
======
* Research Assistant (September 2024-January 2025)<br>
    Research Title: Desirable Properties of Concrete to be used with High strength Steel rebar in RC structure - A Review
 <I>(A Memorandum of Understanding between Public Works Department (PWD) Bangladesh and GPH Ispat Limited)</i><be>
    Funding Agency: GPH Ispat Limited
    Grant Amount: $3000<br>
    Summary: This project aims to study the compatibility of high strength steel reinforcement with various concrete characteristics used in Bangladesh. The findings are expected to influence design practices and code provisions in RC structures.
