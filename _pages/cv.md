Education
======

* B.Sc. in Civil Engineering (January,2023)<br>
    Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology<br>
    Concentration: Structural Engineering<br>
    CGPA: 3.707 on a scale of 4.00 [-Details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvdcCC8EIlJtBgrF77L8byXUT0hcVnSh/view?usp=drive_link)<br>
    Class Rank: 8th out of 147 civil engineering students

Research interest
======
* Investigation of the nonlinear behavior and performance of structural systems under extreme loading conditions, including seismic and impact events
* Seismic strengthening of structural systems using smart materials
* Fracture prediction and failure mechanisms of structural elements subjected to impact loading
* Application of additive manufacturing and advanced construction technologies for the repair, retrofitting, and strengthening of deteriorated or seismically vulnerable structures.


Research experience
======
* Research Assistant (September 2024-April 2025)<br>
    Research Title: Seismic behavior of RC frames with high strength rebar and different grades of concrete subjected to different magnitude of axial load
     <br><i>(A research project funded by GPH Ispat Limited in collaboration with the Public Works Department (PWD), Bangladesh)</i><br>
      Funding Agency: GPH Ispat Limited<br>
      Grant Amount: $3000<br>
      Summary: In this joint research initiative between the PWD and GPH Ispat Limited, the study investigates the feasibility of incorporating high-strength reinforcement in reinforced concrete (RC) building design. The research combines an extensive literature review with analytical studies focusing on critical design parameters, including confinement, development length in tension, and crack width. A detailed numerical analysis using finite element modeling is conducted to evaluate the effects of reinforcement grade (400–600 MPa), concrete grade (20–50 MPa), and axial load ratio (up to 0.5, with some exceptions) on the seismic performance of RC frames.

* Collaborative Research with Undergraduate Thesis Supervisor(2023-Present)<br>
     Supervisor: Dr. Debasish Sen<br>
     Institution: Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology<br>
     Conducted collaborative research on various topics (seismic evaluation methods, bond-slip relationship between reinforcement and concrete, masonry infill, etc.) resulting in two published papers and one ongoing project on finite element analysis of masonry infill.
