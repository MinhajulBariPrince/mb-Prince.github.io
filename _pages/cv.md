Education
======

* B.Sc. in Civil Engineering (January,2023)<br>
    Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology<br>
    Concentration: Structural Engineering<br>
    CGPA: 3.707 on a scale of 4.00 [-Details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Dq5vBtmrEPv0bwcRh4kC7Cz_ea_bDvl/view?usp=sharing)<br>
    Class Rank: 8th out of 147 civil engineering students

Research interest
======
* Investigation on global behavior of buildings as well as local behavior of structural elements under seismic loads
* Seismic strengthening of structural bodies using smart materials
* Prediction of fracture in structural bodies under impact and seismic loads
* Understanding wave propagation in structural bodies


Research experience
======
* Research Assistant (September 2024-Present)<br>
    Research Title: Seismic behavior of RC frames with high strength rebar and different grades of concrete subjected to different magnitude of axial load
     <br><i>(A Memorandum of Understanding between Public Works Department (PWD) Bangladesh and GPH Ispat Limited)</i><br>
      Funding Agency: GPH Ispat Limited<br>
      Grant Amount: $3000<br>
      Summary: This project aims to perform a numerical study by finite element analysis of an RC frame by varying the grade of reinforcement (400 MPa ~ 600 MPa), the grade of concrete (20 MPa ~ 50 MPa), and the axial load ratio (up to 0.5 with some exceptions); thus, finding out the effect of these parameters on seismic behavior.

* Collaborative Research with Undergraduate Thesis Supervisor(2023-Present)<br>
     Supervisor: Dr. Debasish Sen<br>
     Institution: Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology<br>
     Conducted collaborative research on various topics (seismic evaluation methods, bond-slip relationship between reinforcement and concrete, masonry infill, etc.) resulting in two published papers and one ongoing project on finite element analysis of masonry infill.
