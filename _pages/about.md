I am Minhajul Bari Prince, and I am thrilled to welcome you to my portfolio. I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity to explore the fascinating fields of fracture mechanics, earthquake mechanics, and seismic strengthening of structural bodies. Specifically, my areas of interest include the global behavior of buildings and the local behavior of structural elements under seismic loads, seismic strengthening of structural bodies using smart materials, prediction of fractures in structural bodies under impact and seismic loads, and understanding how waves propagate through structural bodies under different phenomena, such as impact and lateral loads.

I completed my BSc in Civil Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, concentrating in Structural Engineering. After completing my BSc, I started working at Khaled Group of Companies as a structural safety engineer. In response to the [Rana Plaza](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/23/rana-plaza-factory-collapse-history-cities-50-buildings) tragedy, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh was established. My responsibilities include ensuring structural safety (i.e., checking structural and non-structural cracks, damping, ensuring allowable load in storage rooms, etc.) of buildings according to Accord guidelines. Moreover, I conducted thorough inspections and assessments to identify potential safety issues and implemented corrective actions. 

In the meantime, I also became involved in collaborative research with my undergraduate thesis supervisor, [Dr. Debasish Sen](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=yoSKNvcAAAAJ&hl=en) n various projects. While working with him, I found more interest in research than in the industry. Therefore, I have continued working with him to this day and have published [two papers] (https://minhajulbariprince.github.io/mb-Prince.github.io//publications/) and currently have [two ongoing research projects](https://minhajulbariprince.github.io/mb-Prince.github.io//CurrentProjects/)

Research Interest======
1. Investigation on global behavior of buildings as well as local behavior of structural elements under seismic loads
2. Seismic strengthening of structural bodies using smart materials. 
3. Prediction of fracture/ crack initiation in structural bodies under impact and seismic loads.
4. Understanding earthquake mechanics on structural bodies
