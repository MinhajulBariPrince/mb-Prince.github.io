title: "Application of High-Strength Reinforcement in Reinforced Concrete Building Design"

excerpt: "
In this collaborative project between the Public Works Department (PWD) of Bangladesh and GPH Ispat Limited, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating high-strength reinforcement in the design of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. The research is primarily grounded in a thorough review of existing literature, supported by analytical studies that focus on critical design parameters (i.e., confinement, development length in tension, and crack width). Additionally, a comparative pushover analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of various rebar grades used in RC structures. A cost-benefit analysis is also performed to assess the economic implications of utilizing different rebar grades. This project aims to provide insights into the potential advantages and challenges of integrating high-strength steel in RC building design in Bangladesh.
