title: "Seismic behavior of RC frames with high strength rebar and different grades of concrete subjected to different magnitudes of axial load"

excerpt: "
In this collaborative project between the Public Works Department (PWD) of Bangladesh and GPH Ispat Limited, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating high-strength reinforcement in the design of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. The research is primarily grounded in a thorough review of existing literature, supported by analytical studies that focus on critical design parameters (i.e., confinement, development length in tension, and crack width). Additionally, This project aims to perform a numerical study by finite element analysis of an RC frame by varying the grade of reinforcement (400 MPa ~ 600 MPa), the grade of concrete (20 MPa ~ 50 MPa), and the axial load ratio (up to 0.5 with some exceptions); thus, finding out the effect of these parameters on seismic behavior. The manuscript of the research paper is currently under review in Innovative Infrastructure Solutions.
