title: "Validation of Finite Element Modeling Strategies for Masonry-Infilled RC Frames: Experimental Comparison and Parametric Analysis of Masonry Stiffness Effects Under Lateral Loads"
excerpt: "In this study, a simplified micro-modeling approach is used for finite element modeling. Drucker-Prager and concrete damage plasticity models are used for modeling masonry and concrete units, respectively. A bilinear steel modeling approach is used for modeling reinforcement. The interface between brick-brick and frame-brick is modeled using surface-based cohesive behavior. The main aim of this study is to propose a well-defined FEM strategy and validate it with experimental data from references. A parametric study of varying stiffness of masonry infill will also be performed to better understand its effect on the global behavior of RC frames under lateral loads.
