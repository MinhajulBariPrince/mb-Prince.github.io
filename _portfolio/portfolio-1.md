title: "Seismic behavior of RC frames with high strength rebar and different grades of concrete subjected to different magnitudes of axial load"

excerpt: "
In this collaborative project between the Public Works Department (PWD) of Bangladesh and GPH Ispat Limited, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating high-strength reinforcement in the design of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. The research is primarily grounded in a thorough review of existing literature, supported by analytical studies that focus on critical design parameters (i.e., confinement, development length in tension, and crack width). Additionally, A detailed numerical analysis using finite element modeling is conducted to evaluate the effects of reinforcement grade (400–600 MPa), concrete grade (20–50 MPa), and axial load ratio (up to 0.5, with some exceptions) on the seismic performance of RC frames. The manuscript of the research paper is currently under review in a journal.
