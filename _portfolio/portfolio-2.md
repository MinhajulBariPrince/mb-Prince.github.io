title: "Validation of Finite Element Modeling Strategies for Masonry-Infilled RC Frames: Experimental Comparison and Parametric Analysis of Masonry Stiffness Effects Under Lateral Loads"
excerpt: "In this study, a simplified micro-modeling approach is adopted for finite element analysis. The masonry and concrete components are modeled using the Drucker–Prager and Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) models, respectively, while a bilinear steel model is employed to represent the reinforcement behavior. The interfaces between brick–brick and frame–brick are simulated using surface-based cohesive interactions. The primary objective of this research is to establish a robust finite element modeling (FEM) strategy and validate it against experimental data obtained from Professor Maeda’s laboratory at Tohoku University. Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of varying masonry infill stiffness on the global behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) frames subjected to lateral loading. The manuscript of this research is currently under review in a peer-reviewed journal.
