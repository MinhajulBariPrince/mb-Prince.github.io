title: "Predicting Bond Stress Parameters in Reinforced Concrete using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks: A Data-Driven Approach"

excerpt: "This ongoing study investigates the use of neural networks to predict post-peak bond-slip relationships in reinforced concrete. Motivated by anomalies in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) during pullout tests, particularly in predicting maximum bond stress and capturing non-linearity, this research aims to improve accuracy. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, preliminary findings and challenges are discussed, with comparisons to FEA results to validate neural network efficacy."
