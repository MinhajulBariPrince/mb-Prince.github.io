title: "Predicting Bond Stress-Slip Parameters in Reinforced Concrete using Artifical Neural Networks"

excerpt: "This ongoing study is prompted by anomalies observed in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results during pullout tests of reinforced concrete, particularly in predicting maximum bond stress and capturing the non-linear post-peak behavior of the bond stress-slip relationship. Furthermore, FEA struggles to accurately predict parameters of the post-peak bond stress-slip relationship. Hence, this research aims to explore the potential of neural networks in predicting bond stress-slip relationships in reinforced concrete specimens."
